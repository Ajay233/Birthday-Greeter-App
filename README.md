# Birthday Greeter App

This was an exercise that was part of our third week on the Makers bootcamp and formed part of our introduction to the web.

The aim of this exercise was to build a simple web app that has a GET and a POST route.  The
the user should begin by entering their name and date of birth on the first page.  The
information should be sent via a POST request so that the number of days until the user's birthday could be calculated and displayed on another page in a message to the user.

To create the app I used:
- Sinatra
- Ruby
- HTML
- CSS

For testing I used:
- Rspec
- Capybara

The app has been deployed to https://makers-wk3-birthday-greeter.herokuapp.com/ so please feel free to have a look and try it out.

Below is a screenshot of the welcome page where the information is obtained from the user.

The next page is where the result of the calculation is displayed so the user is advised of how many days it is until their birthday.
