# Birthday Greeter App

The aim of this exercise was to build a simple web app that has a GET and a POST route.  The
the user should begin by entering their name and date of birth on the first page.  The
information should be sent via a POST request so that the number of days until the user's birthday could be calculated and displayed on another page in a message to the user.

To create the app I used:
- Sinatra
- Ruby
- HTML
- CSS

For testing I used:
- Rspec
- Capybara
